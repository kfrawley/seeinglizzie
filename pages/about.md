<div class="title"><h1 class="display-1">About this Project:</h1></div>
<p>The references in this collection have been compiled through research into the Wylie Family Archival collection, which includes letters written between family members and friends, as well as personal journals. The bulk of the family correspondence in the collection dates from 1850 through 1930</p>
<p>The aim is to capture and document the previously underrepresented narrative of Elizabeth "Lizzie" Breckenridge, recontextualizing her story within its historical framework. The Wylie family, with their prominent members and strong ties to Bloomington's history and Indiana University, has contributed a valuable archival collection that proves beneficial to researchers and relevant communities.</p>
<p>The deliberately narrow focus on Lizzie aims to prioritize materials directly related to comprehending Elizabeth Breckenridge's role, as indicated by limited references to her within the Wylie Family Correspondence archival collection. This approach ensures that her narrative remains central within the collection, shedding light on a previously overlooked aspect of history.</p>
<p>This repository was created to highlight the role that Elizabeth “Lizzie” Breckenridge held in the Wylie Family household, both in terms of her personal relationships and occupational responsibilities. There are over 300 references to Lizzie found within family correspondence and personal diaries.</p>
<p>References to Elizabeth “Lizzie” Breckenridge in Wylie Family letters and diaries have been researched, transcribed, digitized, and encoded for this project.</p>
