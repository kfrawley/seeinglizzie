<div class="body">
<p>Lizzie Breckenridge's early years remain shrouded in limited historical knowledge. Her first documented appearance occurs in the 1850 Federal Census under the name "Elizabeth Brackenridge," where she is listed as the eight-year-old daughter of Hannah Brackenridge. Born on July 5th, 1843, in Bedford, Indiana, Lizzie was part of a family of five, all categorized as mulatto. Notably, Indiana, a Union state, had prohibited slavery since its inception in 1816 and had emancipated all remaining slaves by 1820. Thus, Lizzie did not spend her life as an enslaved person, but rather as a domestic servant.</p>

Her presence in these documents is often associated with tasks such as cooking, gardening, cleaning, and even tending to children who eagerly offered their assistance.</p>
